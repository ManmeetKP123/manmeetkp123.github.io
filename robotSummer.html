							<p>ENPH 253 was the most fun, frustrating, exciting, time-consuming course that
								I took over the summer of 2021. After a 2 weeks introduction to different 
								circuit components and their functionality, we were assigned the task of 
								manufacturing a fully-functional autonomous can-collecting robot. We were divided
								into teams of four and since the summer of 2021
								was online, we were expected to construct not one but four, yes 4, fully-functional robots within
								3 weeks.
								This process required careful mediation and delegation of tasks, meeting tight-deadlines, 
								working in a team under stressful conditions, and of course--making 4 robots!
							</p>
							<p>I will present us with a general overview of the design process and dive briefly into technical details 
								about the different components of the robot.
							</p>
							<h2>Overview</h2>
							<p>Following were the main constraints and requirements for the robot:</p>
							<ul>
								<li>
									The robot was responsible to pick-up 6 cans placed randomly along an 8" by 8" tape
									path. 
								</li>
								<li> 
									After collection, it had to deposit the cans in an upright position in a cardboard silo. 
									Cans placed in any other orientation were awarded zero points.
								</li>
								<li>
									Traversing along the tape-path, collecting, and depositing the cans had to be accomplished
									in under 1 minute.
								</li>
								<li>There was an optional skycrane component where the robot had to be lowered by a skycrane 
									before it started can-collection. The time required to lower the robot from the skycrane 
									was included in the 1 minute constraint. 
								</li>
								<li>
									The robot was restricted to a maximum 24" dimension in all directions at all times.
								</li>
							</ul>
							<p>Now let's take a look at how my team and I accomplished this task and what we learned throughout the 
								process.
							</p>
							<h3 class="connectHeader">Mechanical Components</h3>
							<p>
								We began our design process by brainstorming and prototyping 4 different designs. Ultimately, we
								had to discard most of them since they either required too much power or did not fit the dimensional 
								constraints. Following is a sketch of the design that we decided upon for the robot.
								<center>
								<img class="image robot" src="images/Dimention_Diagram.png"></center>
							</p>
							<p>
								Some of the features that made us choose this model instead of the others were:
							</p>
								<ul>
									<li>It incorporated storage area for 3 cans.</li>
									<li>The collection of the can using the ramp required a single servo
										motor.
									</li>
									<li>The disposal of the cans could also be accomplished using a single 
										SG90 micro servo and a rack-and-pinion piston.
									</li>
								</ul>
							
							<p>
								After ensuring that the robot met the constraints and accomplished the task 
								using the components that we had, we prototyped a CAD model of the design 
								in OnShape, the screenshot for which is included below. 
								I have included the left, right, and top view of the model as well
								in order to better show the most prominent features. </p>
								<p>As you can see in the image 
								below, we made some changes from the sketch--including adding a wedge on the ramp to ensure that the 
								can rolled into the storage container and did not fly out as the ramp rotated up.
								The image also shows the servo placements for the ramp and the sweeper arm.

									<img class="image robot" src="images/rightView.png"></center>
									<p><center><em>Isometric view of the right side of the robot showing the 
										ejection pocket and its placement with respect to the silo.</em></center></p>
								
							</p>
							<p>We will discuss the two main components of the mechanical model in further detail. These two 
								components are:
								<ul>
									<li><strong>Rack-and-Pinion Piston</strong>: This piston was designed 
									to convert the rotational motion of the servo into a linear motion that could 
								    eject the can out the pocket on the right side. The gear of the piston had 20 teeth
									and it's diameter was 8cm.
									<center><img class="image robot" src="images/piston.png"></center>
								</li>
									<li><strong>The Sweeper Arm</strong>: Figuring out the configuration for this arm
									was crucial since it was responsible for collecting the detected cans. After prototyping, 
									analyzing, and re-iterating this process several times, we found the "perfect" configuration.
									The arm had to be bent at certain points as shown as this would result in a scoop shape which helps
									in easier collection of cans. After experimenting with the design, 
									we also realized that the arm had to be offset from the robot body 
									otherwise it would be required to rotate upwards with the ramp.
									The final arm orientation with the SG90 micro servo placement is shown below.

								</li>
								</ul>
							</p>
							<h3 class="connectHeader">Electrical Components</h3>
							<p>
								The most crucial and the circuit that required a week worth of debugging
								was the h-bridge circuit. We decided to solder all of our electrical components
								which, to our dismay, induced some unexpected issues. Every time we constructed an h-bridge 
								circuit on a breadboard it worked fine but the moment we soldered the components,
								it would stop working. The main reason why we kept running into this issue was the prescence
								of burnt MOSFETs in our circuit. Therefore, after countless hours spent soldering in our 
								living rooms (yes, this is where soldering summer originated from!), we would have to spent 
								numerous more hours debugging the circuit, checking every single MOSFET, de-soldering, and 
								iterating the cycle over and over until we finally had two working h-bridges for each robot. </p>
								<p>The pre-liminary 
								circuitry of the robot looked as shown in the picture below but as we added more components
								and more circuits, this soon became a spaghetti-mess of wires.
								<center><img class="image robot" src="images/electronics.jpg"></center>
							</p>
							<p>The circuit in the protoboard is the power adaptor circuit that we built in order to convert 
								the 12V from the battery to 3.3V for the bluepill and 5V for DC motors. We decided to keep this circuit 
								in the protoboard as the weight distribution of the robot allowed this and this would also prevent 
								any issues occuring from soldering and burning components. This circuit also contributed some noise 
								in the overall circuit and to resolve this issue we added capacitors in the power rails of the protoboard.
							</p>
							<p>Let's talk very briefly about the bluepill circuitry. We were provided with a STM32 bluepill, which 
								despite being a very powerful chip, had limited number of pins. Therefore, in order to ensure that 
								we were using all the pins wisely, we constructed a pinout diagram for the bluepill, which is shown below.
								<center><img class="image robot" src="images/pinoutBluePill.png"></center>
							</p>
							<p>We also constructed a circuit diagram with all the necessary circuit components to ensure 
								proper distribution of voltage and power among components. The image of the same is shown below.
								Both the images are taken from our design proposal that we presented to the instructors before 
								we commenced the manufacturing process of the robot. 
								<center><img class="image robot" src="images/circuitBluepill.png"></center>
								
							</p>
							<p>Another crucial circuit was the IR-sensor circuit. In order to tape follow, we decided to 
								use IR sensors to detect the prescence of the black tape-path. We created an array of 5 IR
								sensors which outputted a value of 0 or 1 depending on whether the tape was underneath the 
								sensor or not. The result of this reading, which was discrete in nature, was an array 
								representing the position of the sensors with respect to the black tape. This enabled us to 
								employ differential steering to keep the robot on track. As shown in the picture below, we used
								black tape to shield the sensors from each other and prevent any resulting noise.
								<center><img class="image robot" src="images/pid.jpg"></center>
							</p>
						
							<h3 class="connectHeader">PID</h3>
							<p>After constructing the above circuits and manufacturing the robot, we had to tune the PID 
								to enable the robot to line follow. This required a lot of trial and error with some 
								guided experimentation. We experimented with the P value first and turned off D and I.
								P value was increased until the robot reached a point of minimal oscillations. To dampen 
								the resulting oscillations, we then added the D term and increased it until there were no 
								further oscillations. In our robot design, we ended up not using an I term at all and the P and 
								D terms sufficied.
							</p>
							<h3 class="connectHeader">Integration</h3>
							<p>Almost there!</p>
							<p>To make the entire system work as a whole, a lot of tweaking was done few days before the competition. 
								I have included the links to some videos below which show the progression of the robot from a stupid
								machine to an autonomous recovery system robot!
								<ul>
									<li>Can <a href="https://youtu.be/I68AALMUYPc">collection sequence.</a></li>
									<li>Tuning the <a href="https://youtu.be/o_ARKmnNJEg">PID</a> ft. a very excited hey! when the robot 
									turned at a convoluted turn.</li>
									<li>And finally, <a href="https://youtu.be/Ip5TotQJ3Ks" target="_blank">the perfect run!</a></li>
								</ul>

							<h3 class="connectHeader">Final Remarks</h3>
							<p>Overall, this project was a great learning experience since I developed core engineering skills which I did not 
								have before. No matter how frustrating soldering and de-soldering was, seeing the final circuit work 
								brought joy every time without a fail. Throughout this design process I learnt a lot about teamwork,
								how to come up with creative solutions quickly, and most importantly how to solve mechanical and electrical
								problems. One big takeaway from this project is the problem-solving skills that we all developed which allowed 
								us to go from engineering students learning about transistors to engineering students who manufactured 
								a fully functional autonomous robot! Check out the github below to take a look at our final code.
